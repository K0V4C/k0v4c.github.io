Hi. Well, I&rsquo;m gonna try to say few thing s about me without sounding AI generated.
I am Lazar, born in Serbia and have lived here for my whole life. Like many others I got addicted to coding from the love of playing video games and wanting to create them too.

<p>Hi. Well, I&rsquo;m gonna try to say few thing s about me without sounding AI generated.</p>
<p>I am Lazar, born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia">Serbia</a> and have lived here for my whole life.

My taste might have gone in other direction (now doing more low-level stuff) but my aspirations for this field have stemmed from playing video games.</p>
<p>If you wanna try a few that I recommend go for these:
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/374320/DARK_SOULS_III/">Dark Souls 3</a>
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/105600/Terraria/">Terraria</a>

<p>I also love outdoors, hiking, climbing, boldering, running, weight training (like every other Junior Software Engineer). Still don&rsquo;t know if it is mandatory to like thse things to become a Junior or is it other way around.</p>
